# Coffee Shop website

It is landing page for a generic Coffee Shop, I made in April, 2020, while learning Bootstrap and jQuery.
Leaflet was an later addition to learn adding pins into maps.

## Consists of several sections:
Hero - which is over whole screen, has an image background, title and text which fills it, 
an element which is over image and acts as an filter in order to make text more readable.
And absolute positioned arrow to indicate direction to other sections.

### Others are :

* Intro
* About
* Products
* Map
* Contact Info
* Mobile Menu
* Header
* Footer

## Libraries and frameworks used:

* Bootstrap - CSS and JS library used for layout, styling of elements and text.
* Leaflet - JavaScript library used for addding interactive maps and pins in those maps.
* jQuery - JS library which which makes code smaller and easier to write and use, with its
simpler syntax.
